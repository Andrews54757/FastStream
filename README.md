# FastStream 2

Tired of having to wait while videos buffer? This extension will replace videos on websites with a custom player that is designed to play without buffering.

1. Take advantage of accelerated download speeds with automatic fragmentation and parallel requests.
2. Pre-download the video by letting it run in the background. Then instantly save the video as an mp4 file at the push of a button.

The player works with a variety of media, from MP4 videos, HLS streams, and DASH manifests (experimental).

Beyond that, the player has a bunch of features to make life easier. It has OpenSubtitles support so you can search their subtitle database directly from the player. The player has precise video previews which you can see as you hover over the timeline. It has useful keybinds, from having keys for different skip durations, to having a keybind to quickly hide the player.

Should you like binging shows, the player also comes equipped with a custom video analysis system that runs in the background to identify intro/outro sequences based on repetitive scenes.

To use the player, simply go to any website you want with a video and toggle the extension on. Any video it detects will be automatically replaced with the new player.

Notes:
- This player will not function with DRM protected content.
- This player is still a work-in-progress. Please report any bugs to the Github issue tracker here: https://github.com/Andrews54757/FastStream/issues
